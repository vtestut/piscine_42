# 42 Paris Entrance Exam - July 2022
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the 42 Paris Entrance Exam held in July 2022.

This repository encompasses all the work I've been able to accomplish in one month.  
This competition serves as a good introduction to the programming world.  
First we had an initiation into using a terminal and a shell. Then the 'C' part taught us, through small exercices, the management and manipulation of variables, understanding and handling memory, pointers, and much more.

42 Paris is a renowned coding school that offers a unique and innovative pedagogy. The admission process is challenging, emphasizing problem-solving skills, creativity, and collaborative learning.
